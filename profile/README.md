# WiiQare Remittance Project

## WiiQare Project Charter

### Vision Statement. 

To empower Africans to finance their healthcare and help hospitals in Africa get paid.

### Mission Statement. 

Our mission is to build a healthcare remittance system to connect payers, patients, and providers,  simplifying healthcare payments and improving access to quality care. WiiQareâ€™s platform allows Africans abroad to pay for the medical expenses of loved ones back home in a manner that is fast, with zero fees, secure, and transparent.

### Community Statement.

Because health finance is a large and complex problem, we are framing our solution as an open-source project. We welcome contributions from the broader community including developers, finance professionals, crypto and blockchain enthusiasts, healthcare providers, African migrants and their families, governments, NGOs, diaspora groups, and other partnering organizations.

Input from a variety of contributors will ensure the platform is accessible and adaptable to different contexts and needs. In addition, we are confident building an open-source solution will ultimately result in a more robust, secure, and impactful solution.

We recognize the importance of collaboration and inclusivity in creating a solution that works for everyone. We prioritize transparency, fairness, and ethical conduct in all our actions and decisions. We will work collaboratively with all stakeholders to ensure that our platform is sustainable, impactful, and aligned with our shared values.

Together, we can build a better future for healthcare financing and create a world where everyone has equal access to quality care.

### Licensing Strategy:

We will ensure that our platform complies with all necessary regulations and licenses required to operate in the countries we serve. We will prioritize transparency and compliance to build trust with our users and stakeholders. We will also explore partnerships with financial institutions to leverage their expertise and resources in navigating complex regulatory environments.
